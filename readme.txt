WooFlare provides automated Cloudflare cache control for WooCommerce stores.

== Description ==

Cloudflare provides caching, security and optimization services for websites all around the internet. WooFlare integrates Cloudflare directly with WooCommerce stores to allow store owners to automate these optimizations in a variety of ways (when a product goes out of stock, when a sale ends, etc.).

Automate your WooCommerce store's caching optimization and free up more time to sell your products!

** This plugin relies on the use of Cloudflare, a third-party service that increases security and performance for web sites and services across the internet. For more information, visit the [Cloudflare website](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/). This plugin is not officially endorsed, built or maintained by the Cloudflare team; rather, we are a development company that uses their services every day! **

== Installation ==

1. Upload `WooFlare` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ menu in WordPress
